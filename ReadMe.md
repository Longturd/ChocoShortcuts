# Chocolatey Shortcuts ![Icon](./Icon.png)

Launch command line menus via file shortcuts for installing, updating, and uninstalling [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages. 

Generate shortcuts for each of your packages to a portable directory of your choice.

At installation, a "Chocolatey Shortcuts" folder is placed on your desktop. Rename or move it as you like (I keep mine synced between computers in Dropbox). 

Create shortcuts for packages using "+Add Package Shortcuts". There you'll find options to generate shortcuts individually or in bulk, as well as a search function for finding package IDs.

Launching package shortcuts will present you with options to install (if not installed), update (if available), or uninstall packages. Update multiple packages at once using "+Check for Package Updates".
